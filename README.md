# Rails Go to Spec V3 extension for VSCODE

This extension is a fork of https://github.com/sporto/rails-go-to-spec-vscode

Jump between code and spec in Rails projects.

To install search for

```
rails-go-to-spec-v3
```

The difference with the original is that this extension allows you to â€˜Go to Specâ€™ when have a service, and for each method of the service, there is a different spec file.

For example:

```ruby
# public/some_service.rb
module SomeService
  extend self

  def method_name_1
    # ...
  end

  def method_name_2
    # ...
  end
end

# public/spec/some_service/method_name_1_spec.rb
describe SomeService, "#method_name_1" do
  # ...
end

# public/spec/some_service/method_name_2_spec.rb
describe SomeService, "#method_name_2" do
  # ...
end
```

**IMPORTANT ðŸ‘€:**
To make it to work
 - You need to place the cursor on the method name.
 - The service must be in the `/public/` folder
